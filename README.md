## Lessons Learned

This project started as an academic assignment, which led me to explore multiple examples in search of the perfect solution. However, I soon realized that the existing solutions did not meet my expectations or align with my goals. This revelation was the catalyst for developing DataWise Migrator from scratch, an application that not only met my requirements but also offered a streamlined user experience.

During this process, I dove into a variety of libraries, selecting those that promised efficiency and simplicity. Documentation became my constant companion, and through an iterative cycle of testing and tweaking, I managed to build robust code that facilitates data migration reliably and from any end.

This development journey not only taught me about the importance of a strong code base and selecting the right tools, but also reinforced my ability to overcome technical obstacles and adapt to changing project needs.
